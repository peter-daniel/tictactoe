#Simple Tic Tac Toe game



A bit of a Slack branding exercise - using CSS jQuery and HTML5.

Choose if you want to play a person of computer - computer AI is not ready.

Choose a token colour and play unlimited.

If a player wins - that player goes first on the next round.

There is a 5 second timer that decrements the players score if it times out.
